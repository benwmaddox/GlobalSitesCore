This is a project I use as a submodule for some of my multi-lingual static sites.

Please run this in the command line for the project:

```
npm run init
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Once you're ready to start trying the site run this:

```
npm run watch
```

If you're using VSCode or Cursor, run the command "open with live server".
