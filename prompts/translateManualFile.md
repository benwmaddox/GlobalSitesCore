This is an i18next translation file. Everything with \[\[ and \]\] should be replaced with a real translation. Only show the lines that need to be altered.

Note that ending in \_one, \_other, \_few, \_many should be treated as pluralization rules. It should not be included as a translated word. The keys are the original phrase.

If @this is a url json file, use - instead of spaces in the results.
